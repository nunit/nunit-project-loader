        BUILD.CAKE

        This script builds the {BuildSettings.Title} project. It makes use of
        NUnit.Cake.Recipe, which provides a number of built-in options and
        tasks. You may define additional options and tasks in build.cake or
        in additional cake files you load from build.cake. Recipe options may 
        be specified in abbreviated form, down to the minimum length shown in
        square braces. Single character abbreviations use a single dash.

        Usage: build [options]

        Options:

            --target=TARGET         [-t]

                The name of the configuration to build. Default is Release.

            --packageVersion        [--pack]
                Specifies the full package version, including any pre-release
                suffix. If provided, this version is used directly in place of
                the default version calculated by the script.

            --where=SELECTION       [-w]
                Specifies a selction expression used to choose which packages
                to build and test, for use in debugging. Consists of one or
                more specifications, separated by '|' and '&'. Each specification
                is of the form "prop=value", where prop may be either id or type.
                Examples:
                    --where type=nuget

                Indicates that the Build task should not be run even if other
                tasks depend on it. The existing build is used instead.
